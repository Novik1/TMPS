# Behavioral Design Patterns
### Author: Novitchii Nichita
## Objectives:
- Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.
- As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system.
- Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.

## Used Design and Creational Patterns:
- Builder
- Visitor

## Implementation
In base I have taken BuilderDP fom my laboratory work 1, but additional features were realised by using Visitor design pattern

**Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

The **Visitor** pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes on which it operates.
